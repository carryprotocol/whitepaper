\section{General Infrastructure for Both Web2.0 and Web3.0 Games}


At the most basic level, Carry SDK assists developers in integrating blockchain technology into both traditional and emerging Web3 games. It does not mean building every blockchain game from scratch to completion, which takes a massive amount of time and is a non-standardized process that serves only a limited number of users. From the perspective of efficiency, we want this integration to be a standardized and minimized process.

Specifically, the proposed infrastructure is composed of three fundamental modules (Asset Management Module, Identity Management Module, and Security Protection Module) and two novel modules (Ad Managment Module and Data Analysis Module). 

\subsection{Asset Management Module}
% We will first need to clarify the core differences between traditional and blockchain games to begin this process. In blockchain games, users control their own game assets, independent of any distinguishable facets of gameplay or mechanics. 

% Carry Game Infrastructure is addressing a critical issue in games: the ownership and control of in-game assets. Traditionally, these assets are merely data on a server, which doesn't guarantee players' permanent control over them. Carry uses blockchain concepts, specifically fungible and non-fungible tokens (FTs \& NFTs), to give players a more reliable way to own and use their assets within games. This shift means that the existence and ownership of an asset aren't solely tied to the game itself but are secured on the blockchain.
The Asset Management Module aims to revolutionize the ownership and tradeability of in-game assets through blockchain technology. By leveraging fungible tokens (FTs) for in-game currencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) for unique items, this module ensures true ownership, provenance, and interoperability of assets across different gaming platforms and ecosystems. The core designs are composed of the following three elements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Tokenization:} Utilizing ERC-20 (for FTs) and ERC-721 or ERC-1155 (for NFTs) standards to represent in-game currencies and items on the blockchain.
\item \textbf{Smart Contracts:} Deploying smart contracts to handle the logic for asset creation, ownership transfer, and transactions, ensuring transparency and security.
\item \textbf{Blockchain Layer:} Integration with a blockchain layer (e.g., Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain) for decentralized asset management and to leverage its security protocols.
\end{itemize}

Based on the elements mentioned above, the processes can be summarized as follows: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Define asset classes and attributes in smart contracts.
    \item Deploy contracts to the blockchain, generating a unique address for each asset.
    \item Implement game logic to interact with blockchain for asset transactions using Carry SDK.
    \item Use event listeners for real-time updates on asset state changes within the game environment.
\end{enumerate}




\subsection{Identity Management Module}
% In the realm of user identity, traditional games rely on conventional methods like email addresses or social accounts for user registration and login. Carry introduces a new paradigm with Web3, where on-chain addresses become the primary identifier. This approach extends the scope of user interaction beyond just games, as the user's identity and activities are independent of the game server. However, integrating these blockchain elements into games has been challenging for many developers, especially those with extensive experience in traditional game development but limited knowledge of blockchain technology.

% To bridge this gap, Carry has developed a comprehensive Software Development Kit (SDK), making it easier for developers to include blockchain features in their games without needing extensive blockchain expertise. The SDK facilitates the binding of a player's wallet address to their game account, allowing a combination of in-game and blockchain-based accounts. It also enables the tokenization of in-game assets, aligning them with corresponding blockchain contracts. This functionality extends to various asset interactions, such as token generation, minting, and transfers, directly through players' Web3 wallets. Carry's SDK, designed for simplicity and security, provides a range of standardized APIs that developers can use to set up a token-based game economy. It supports various blockchain networks and is compatible with multiple client platforms, enhancing its versatility. 
This module seeks to establish a decentralized identity system that allows game players to use a single, secure, and persistent identity across both Web2 and Web3 gaming platforms. By incorporating Decentralized Identifiers (DID) \cite{reed2020decentralized}, it aims to enhance user privacy, security, and cross-platform interoperability. The core designs are composed of the following three elements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{DID Integration:} Utilizing the DID standard for creating verifiable, self-sovereign digital identities tied to blockchain addresses.
\item \textbf{Wallet Binding:} Facilitating the binding of a playerâ€™s wallet to their game account, enabling seamless in-game and blockchain interactions.
\item \textbf{SDK Features:} Providing APIs within Carry SDK for easy integration of DIDs, supporting login, authentication, and asset management.
\end{itemize}

The focus is on ensuring the integrity and security of in-game transactions and digital asset management. By incorporating advanced cryptographic techniques such as multi-party computation (MPC) \cite{feng2023efficient} and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) \cite{wang2023zero}, this module aims to protect user assets, maintain privacy, and secure transactions without compromising on user experience.  The core designs are composed of the following three elements:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Cryptography:} Implementing MPC for secure, distributed private key management and ZKP for transaction validation without revealing sensitive information.
\item \textbf{Smart Contract Security:} Employing security practices like audits and formal verification to ensure smart contract integrity.
\item \textbf{SDK Security:} Ensuring the Carry SDK incorporates the latest security protocols for interaction with blockchain networks, including secure API calls and encryption of sensitive data.
\end{itemize}
 Based on the elements mentioned above, the processes can be summarized as follows: 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Implement MPC protocols for key management, allowing transactions without exposing private keys.
    \item Use ZKP for transaction validation, ensuring privacy and security.
    \item Conduct regular security audits and update smart contracts and SDK accordingly.
    \item Integrate secure, encrypted communication channels within Carry SDK for asset and identity management.
\end{enumerate}
