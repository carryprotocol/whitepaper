% \subsection{Strategy Simulation}


% The Carry Protocol includes a special feature that lets you try out different strategies directly within the blockchain system to see what works best. This tool uses smart contracts, which are like automated rules, to make a secure space for testing. Here, you can change settings and watch how they affect outcomes, helping you make better decisions as you go along.

% Core concepts in experimentation for Carry are:

% \textbf{Variables:} A variable is the basic unit which strategy makers are trying to measure. Whether it's the slot's visibility, its position in the game interface, or the duration of the ad it holds, these variables dictate the behavior of users, regarding certain types of slots. Adjusting them using decentralized logic helps to find the optimal setting for each slot or group of slots.

% \textbf{Groups:} Groups can be a collection of any basic unit in the entire carry protocol, cluster of slots, chosen user addresses, gamers in a certain region etc. Groups are a tool for conducting experiments in a scalable way.

% \textbf{Experiments:} Each 'experiment' revolves around these slots and their groups. Being smart contracts, they execute tests autonomously on these slot configurations. The experiments can range from testing a new slot position to trying out different ad durations. As these experiments run, they yield data, offering insights into the most effective slot configurations.

% \textbf{Rollouts:} Once an experiment concludes, the 'rollouts' come into play. They are the action-driven aftermath of successful experiments, ensuring that proven slot configurations, those variables and group settings that worked, are implemented across the board. It's like upgrading a group of slots based on real, tested data.
